<p>We are excited to announce the release of
<a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/">gsDesign2</a> 1.1.1.
This is a maintenance update that brings both new features and improvements.
Built upon the <a href="https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign/">gsDesign</a> experience,
gsDesign2 is an R package designed for group sequential clinical trial design
under non-proportional hazards.</p>
<p>You can install gsDesign2 from CRAN with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;gsDesign2&quot;)</code></pre>

<h2>What’s new in gsDesign2 1.1.1</h2>
<p>Highlights of this release include the new method for generating RTF table
outputs, more rigorous input checking, and performance optimizations.
We also continued to improve our documentation and package infrastructure.
For the detailed changes, see the complete <a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/news/">changelog</a>.</p>

<h3>New features and improvements</h3>
<p><strong>RTF output support</strong>:
Besides the <a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/reference/as_gt.html"><code>as_gt()</code></a> method,
users can now use the <a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/reference/as_rtf.html"><code>as_rtf()</code></a> method
to generate (well-formatted) RTF tables for <code>fixed_design</code> and <code>gs_design</code> objects.
This feature was requested by many users and is now implemented by
our colleague <a href="https://github.com/fukuhiro2023"><span class="citation">@fukuhiro2023</span></a>.
The RTF output feature could facilitate the direct integration of trial design
outputs into reports widely used in clinical study documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Performance optimizations</strong>:
We have optimized the speed of
<a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/reference/gs_power_ahr.html"><code>gs_power_ahr()</code></a>,
a key function used to compute group sequential design power using average
hazard ratio under non-proportional hazards. This performance improvement was
achieved through refactoring the tabular data transformations using the
data.table package, verifying our experience gained
<a href="/blog/simtrial-0-3-2/">optimizing the simtrial package</a>.
Similar improvements have also been applied to <code>gs_info_ahr()</code> and <code>pw_info()</code>.</p>

<div id="bug-fixes" class="section level3">
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<p><strong>Better input checking</strong>:
We have made some changes to
<a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/reference/gs_power_wlr.html"><code>gs_power_wlr()</code></a>
and <a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/reference/to_integer.html"><code>to_integer()</code></a>
to ensure rigorous checking and conversion of integer sample sizes, addressing
previously reported issues.</p>
<p>The enrollment and failure rate input constructors/validators
in <a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/reference/define_enroll_rate.html"><code>define_enroll_rate()</code></a> and <a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/reference/define_fail_rate.html"><code>define_fail_rate()</code></a> are
refactored to check only the input data frame content instead of the object class.
This change eliminates superfluous warning messages and catches actual
exceptions as errors properly.</p>
<p><strong>Better exception handling</strong>:
All <code>gs_design_*()</code> functions now provide explicit error handling of scenarios
where all hazard ratios are set to 1 throughout the study.</p>

<div id="documentation-and-maintainability" class="section level3">
<h3>Documentation and maintainability</h3>
<p><strong>Expanded vignettes and examples</strong>:
A new vignette is added to explain the mathematical details of
<a href="https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/articles/story-info-formula.html">statistical information under null and alternative hypotheses</a>.
The descriptions and code examples are improved and expanded for functions like
<code>define_enroll_rate()</code> and <code>define_fail_rate()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure and testing</strong>:
We continued to improve the maintainability of the package by tidying up the
namespace, qualifying namespaces in tests to follow best practices,
and limiting the token usage in GitHub Actions workflows.</p>

<h2>The gsDesign2 preprint</h2>
<p>Led by the package maintainer Yujie Zhao, our arXiv preprint
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01723">Group Sequential Design Under Non-proportional Hazards</a>
explains the core theory and innovation behind gsDesign2.
This paper addresses the challenge of designing clinical trials with
time-to-event endpoints, particularly under non-proportional hazards scenarios.
In the preprint, we introduced analytic forms for design characteristics,
including sample size and boundary derivation. This enables more flexibility
and efficiency of trial design, mirroring a wider range of real-world
treatment possibilities.</p>
